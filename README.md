🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning 🩸
Welcome to the Breast Cancer Detection project! This machine learning-based solution aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using various medical features. The project follows a structured workflow, from data collection to model evaluation. Below is an overview of the steps involved in building this predictive model.

🚀 Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign. Through thorough data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation, the goal is to build an accurate classifier.

🔧 Technologies Used
🐍 Python
📊 Pandas
📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
🧠 Scikit-learn
🧬 Colab Notebook
🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Data Collection & Initial Exploration 📥
Dataset Link: Dataset
Overview: Imported the dataset and inspected it to understand the number of features, labels, and data patterns.
Checked for null values, duplicate columns, and rows.
Handled missing data where applicable.
2. Data Preprocessing 🧹
Removed unwanted columns and handled imbalanced data.
Encoded categorical features using techniques like One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Analyzed the distribution of data.
Compared fraud vs non-fraud transactions.
Visualized correlations and patterns using heatmaps and pair plots.
4. Data Visualization 📊
Applied a range of visualizations:
Boxplot 📦
Countplot 📊
Heatmap 🌡️
Pairplot 🔗
Barplot 📊
Histplot 📈
Scatterplot 🔴
5. Feature Scaling 📏
Scaled the features for better performance and consistency across the dataset.
6. Model Selection & Fitting 🤖
Performed train-test split and trained 4 different models suitable for the dataset.
Compared model accuracies to select the best-performing one.
7. Model Evaluation 📉
Evaluated model performance using key metrics:
Accuracy Score ✅
F1-Score 📈
Classification Report 📄
Confusion Matrix 🔲
📈 Results
After training the models, we compared their performance and selected the best one based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The final model can classify tumors as malignant or benign with high accuracy.
